  <p class="about-text">
    I'm a Full Stack web developer based in Denver, CO and currently enrolled in
    Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program at Denver - Platte.
    Through many years of studying classical piano I have learned the value of
    dedicated practice, mastering techniques, and devotion to detail. I apply
    the same mindset to coding with a diligent but playful and creative spirit, and a thirst for new challenges!
    I love being part of a community that shares ideas and works together to create amazing products, and Iâ€™m excited to join a team that values agile collaboration and continual learning.
