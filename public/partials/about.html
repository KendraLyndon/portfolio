  <p class="about-text">
    Through studying classical piano for many years I have learned the value of
    dedicated practice, mastering techniques, and devotion to detail. I apply
    the same mindset to coding with a diligent but playful and creative spirit,
    and a thirst for new challenges! I love being part of a community that shares
    ideas and works together to create amazing products, and Iâ€™m looking
    to join a team that values agile collaboration and continual learning.
